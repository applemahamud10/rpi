                                construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including
                                public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewage systems, pipelines,
                                structural components of buildings, and railways.
                                Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines. It is
                                considered the second-oldest engineering discipline after military engineering,[3] and
                                it is defined to distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering. Civil
                                engineering can take place in the public sector from municipal public works departments
                                through to federal government agencies, and in the private sector from locally based
                                firms to global Fortune 500 companies.Civil engineering is the application of physical
                                and scientific principles for solving the problems of society, and its history is
                                intricately linked to advances in the understanding of physics and mathematics
                                throughout history.Because civil engineering is a broad profession, including several
                                specialized sub-disciplines, its history is linked to knowledge of structures, materials
                                science, geography, geology, soils, hydrology, environmental science, mechanics, project
                                management, and other fields.

                                and application of equipment, devices, and systems which use electricity, electronics,
                                and electromagnetism. It emerged as an identifiable occupation in the latter half of the
                                19th century after commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and
                                electrical power generation, distribution, and use.
                                Electrical engineering is now divided into a wide range of different fields, including
                                computer engineering, systems engineering, power engineering, telecommunications,
                                radio-frequency engineering, signal processing, instrumentation, photovoltaic cells,
                                electronics, and optics and photonics. Many of these disciplines overlap with other
                                engineering branches, spanning a huge number of specializations including hardware
                                engineering, power electronics, electromagnetics and waves, microwave engineering,

                                electrical materials science.[a]Electrical engineers typically hold a degree in
                                electrical engineering or electronic engineering. Practising engineers may have
                                professional certification and be members of a professional body or an international

                                science, to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems.[1] It is one
                                of the oldest and broadest of the engineering branches.
                                The mechanical engineering field requires an understanding of core areas including
                                mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, materials science, structural analysis, and
                                electricity. In addition to these core principles, mechanical engineers use tools such
                                as computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and product
                                lifecycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment
                                and machinery, heating and cooling systems, transport systems, aircraft, watercraft,
                                robotics, medical devices, weapons, and others. It is the branch of engineering that
                                involves the design, production, and operation of machinery.[2][3]
                                Mechanical engineering emerged as a field during the Industrial Revolution in Europe in
                                the 18th century; however, its development can be traced back several thousand years
                                around the world. In the 19th century, developments in physics led to the development of
                                mechanical engineering science.

                                Algorithms and data structures are central to computer science.[6] The theory of computation concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them. The fields of cryptography and computer security involve studying the means for secure communication and for preventing security vulnerabilities. Computer graphics and computational geometry address the generation of images. Programming language theory considers different ways to describe computational processes, and database theory concerns the management of repositories of data. Human–computer interaction investigates the interfaces through which humans and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind developing software. Areas such as operating systems, networks and embedded systems investigate the principles and design behind complex systems. Computer architecture describes the construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment.

Previously electrical engineering only used passive devices such as mechanical switches, resistors, inductors and capacitors.
                                It covers fields such as: analog electronics, digital electronics, consumer electronics, embedded systems and power electronics. It is also involved in many related fields, for example solid-state physics, radio engineering, telecommunications, control systems, signal processing, systems engineering, computer engineering, instrumentation engineering, electric power control, robotics.
                                The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is one of the most important professional bodies for electronics engineers in the US; the equivalent body in the UK is the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET). The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) publishes electrical standards including those for electronic engineering.

                                <span class="h3">P</span>ower engineering, also called power systems engineering, is a subfield of electrical engineering that deals with the generation, transmission, distribution, and utilization of electric power, and the electrical apparatus connected to such systems. Although much of the field is concerned with the problems of three-phase AC power – the standard for large-scale power transmission and distribution across the modern world – a significant fraction of the field is concerned with the conversion between AC and DC power and the development of specialized power systems such as those used in aircraft or for electric railway networks. Power engineering draws the majority of its theoretical base from electrical engineering.Electricity became a subject of scientific interest in the late 17th century. Over the next two centuries a number of important discoveries were made including the incandescent light bulb and the voltaic pile.[1][2] Probably the greatest discovery with respect to power engineering came from Michael Faraday who in 1831 discovered that a change in magnetic flux induces an electromotive force in a loop of wire—a principle known as electromagnetic induction that helps explain how generators and transformers work.[3]
                                In 1881 two electricians built the world's first power station at Godalming in England. The station employed two waterwheels to produce an alternating current that was used to supply seven Siemens arc lamps at 250 volts and thirty-four incandescent lamps at 40 volts.

In the meantime, there is an opportunity to study electro-medical technology in ISTT and a couple of other private institutions in Bangladesh. All the batches that have passed from ISTT so far are working. At present, there is a great demand for students who have passed in Electro Medical Engineering in all medical college hospitals, district hospitals and upazila hospitals in Bangladesh. Moreover, there are opportunities to pursue higher education in BSc in EEE, BSc in Biomedical Technology. Electro-medical technology is one of the most promising technologies in the modern world for electro-medical students in various sectors including medical institutions. It is learned that medical equipment in government and private hospitals is failing due to lack of skilled manpower. They require highly skilled and experienced electro-medical engineers to maintain them.Institute of science trade & Technology (ISTT) established in 1998 to produce skilled manpower & remove unemployment problem. Institute of science trade & Technology (ISTT) is affiliated institute under Bangladesh Technical Education Board. This institute provided 4 years Diploma in Textile Engineering degree since 2007-08 sessions. Our students achieved outstanding results in Technical board.
